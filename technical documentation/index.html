                            Python is a versatile, cross-platform programming
                            language known for its simplicity and readability.
                            It serves as an object-oriented scripting language
                            and is particularly valued for its compact and
                            lightweight nature. In various host environments,
                            Python seamlessly integrates with the objects within
                            its surroundings, granting developers programmatic
                            control.

                        <p>
                            Python boasts a comprehensive standard library
                            replete with essential objects, including data
                            structures like lists and dictionaries, date and
                            time handling with the datetime module, and
                            mathematical capabilities through the math module.
                            The language also provides a robust set of core
                            elements encompassing operators, control structures,
                            and statements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Python's adaptability shines through its ability to
                            be extended for a myriad of purposes through the
                            incorporation of additional modules and packages:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Client-side Python:</strong> Python
                                extends its core functionality to the
                                client-side, offering modules and libraries that
                                enable applications to manipulate web browsers
                                and their Document Object Models (DOM). This
                                empowers developers to dynamically interact with
                                web pages, responding to user interactions such
                                as clicks, form submissions, and page
                                navigation.

                                <strong>Server-side Python:</strong> On the
                                server-side, Python offers an array of modules
                                tailored to server applications. These modules
                                facilitate tasks such as communicating with
                                databases, maintaining state across multiple
                                invocations of an application, and handling file
                                operations efficiently on a server

                        <p>
                            "Hello, World!" is a classic and simple program that
                            is often used to introduce beginners to a new
                            programming language. In Python, it can be done with
                            just one line of code:
                        </p>
                        <code> print("Hello, World!") </code>
                        <p>
                            You can run this code in a Python environment, and
                            it will display "Hello, world!" in the console.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In Python, you can declare variables by assigning a
                            value to a variable name. You don't need to specify
                            the data type explicitly because Python is
                            dynamically typed. Here's how you declare variables
                            in Python:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            #Variable declaration and assignment variable_name=value # Example variable declarations name ="John"
                            age = 30 is_student = True
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            You can then use these variables in your Python code
                            to store and manipulate data as needed.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Python is a dynamically typed language, which means
                            that you don't need to explicitly declare the data
                            type of a variable. Python infers the data type
                            based on the value assigned to the variable.
                            However, Python supports various data types to
                            represent different kinds of values. Here are some
                            of the common data types in Python:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                int: Represents integer numbers, e.g., 42, -10,
                                0.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                float: Represents floating-point (decimal)
                                numbers, e.g., 3.14, -0.5.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                bool: Represents boolean values, which can be
                                either True or False.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                str: Represents a sequence of characters
                                enclosed in single ('') or double ("") quotes,
                                e.g., "Hello, World!".
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                list: Represents an ordered collection of
                                elements. Lists can contain elements of
                                different data types, and they are mutable (can
                                be changed), e.g., [1, 2, 3, "apple"].
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                tuple: Similar to a list but immutable (cannot
                                be changed), e.g., (1, 2, 3, "banana").
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                set: Represents an unordered collection of
                                unique elements, e.g., {1, 2, 3}.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                dict: Represents a collection of key-value
                                pairs. Keys must be unique, e.g., {"name":
                                "Alice", "age": 30}.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                NoneType: Represents the absence of a value or a
                                null value, denoted by None.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <code>
                            x = 42 print(type(x)) # Outputs: (class 'int') y =
                            "Hello, World!" print(type(y)) # Outputs: (class
                            'str')
                        </code>

                    <header>User Input</header>
                    <article>
                        <p>
                            To take user input in Python, we can use the input()
                            function. Here's the syntax:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            input_string = input("Please enter a value: ")
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            The input() function takes an argument which is the
                            prompt string. The user is prompted to enter a
                            value, and this value is returned as a string. To
                            take integer input, we can use the int() function to
                            convert the string input to an integer. Here's an
                            example:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            input_string = input("Please enter an integer: ")
                            integer_input = int(input_string)
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            To take decimal input, we can use the float()
                            function to convert the string input to a float.
                            Here's an example:
                        </p>
                        <code
                            >input_string = input("Please enter a decimal: ")
                            decimal_input = float(input_string)
                        </code>
