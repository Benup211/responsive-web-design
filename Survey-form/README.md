## Introduction

The HTML code provided in this repository is for a survey form designed for Coursera. It allows users to provide their feedback and opinions on Coursera's services. The form collects information such as the user's name, email, age (optional), current role, whether they would recommend Coursera to a friend, what improvements they would like to see, and any additional comments or suggestions.

## HTML Structure

The HTML code is structured as follows:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: The document type declaration specifying that this is an HTML5 document.
- `<html>`: The root element of the HTML document.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata such as character encoding, viewport settings, and a link to an external stylesheet.
- `<body>`: The main content of the web page.
  - `<div class="container">`: A container that holds the entire form.
    - `<header>`: The header section containing the form title and description.
    - `<main>`: The main content of the web page, which includes the survey form.
      - `<form id="survey-form" action="#" method="post">`: The form element with an action set to "#" (to be replaced with the actual form submission URL) and a POST method.
        - Sections containing form elements like name, email, age, current role, recommendation, improvements, and comments.
        - `<input type="submit" value="Submit" id="submit">`: A submit button to submit the form.

## Form Elements

The survey form includes the following form elements:

- Name (text input)
- Email (email input)
- Age (number input, optional)
- Current Role (dropdown/select)
- Would you recommend Coursera to a friend? (radio buttons)
- What would you like to see improved? (checkboxes)

## Usage

You can use this HTML code as a template for creating a survey form for Coursera or modify it to suit your specific needs. Be sure to replace the form action (`action="#"`) with the actual URL where you want to handle form submissions. Additionally, you can style the form using an external CSS stylesheet (linked in the head section).

To deploy this form on a website, simply upload the HTML file along with any associated CSS and JavaScript files to your web server.
